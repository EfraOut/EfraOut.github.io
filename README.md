# The Book of Mormon Experiment
*This is not an official website from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints*.

## Overview
As a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, I have read the Book of Mormon. I love the Book of Mormon as it has given me peace when I most needed it, and it has helped me on many occasions to move forward.
While I was serving as a missionary, I felt impressed to spread the Book of Mormon through this Experiment using social media.
This is a very basic website that I created as my personal project for my first web class.

## Notes
* The Form in the Request a Copy page doesn't do anything, it's just a placeholder.
* The Beta Testing displays a random page of the Book of Mormon.
