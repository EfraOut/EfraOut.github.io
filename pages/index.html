            <h2>The Book of Mormon Experiment</h2>
            <p>
              Lots of people have heard of the Book of Mormon, but few people
              have actually read it. We want to change that, one page at a time.
              The Book of Mormon Experiment is designed for you to read a single
              page from the most criticized book in religion history, and then
              tell us (and the world!) what you thought about it.

            <h2>Because the Book of Mormon speaks for itself</h2>
            <p>
              If the Book of Mormon is what it claims to be, then it's not
              necessary for people to tell you what it is, but you should be
              able to experience it by yourself. More info on the official site
              can be found
